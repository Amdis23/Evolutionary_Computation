# Evolutionary_Computation
Evolutionary computational techniques to solve NP hard problems.

0
We have tackle two computationally hard problems with evolutionary computation techniques

1) Production Planning in a Petrochemical Industry 
2) Job Shop scheduling problem (JSSP)

and with recent developments in evolutionary compuation techniques we try to code new methods like Artificial Bee colony (ABC) and Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO)

A typical folder constitutes various reading materials, a problem statement and MATLAB files neccesary to execute the code. (Data file, Function file, Main file)
