# Evolutionary_Computation
Evolutionary computational techniques to solve NP hard problems.

I have tackle two computationally hard problems with evolutionary computation techniques

1) Production Planning in a Petrochemical Industry 
2) Job Shop scheduling problem (JSSP)

and with recent developments in evolutionary compuation techniques I try to code new methods like Artificial Bee colony (ABC) and Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO)

A typical folder constitutes various reading materials, a problem statement and MATLAB files neccesary to execute the code. (Data file, Function file, Main file)
